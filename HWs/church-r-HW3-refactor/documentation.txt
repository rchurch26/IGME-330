For my audio visualizer, I removed a lot of the checkboxes that affected the canvas like the emboss, gradient, noise, and inversion while keeping the bars and circles. I added a bass and treble affect to the audio as well as created a class that would draw phylotaxis style circles that would create a pretty starry effect on the background. Inside the av-data.json file, I added the applications title, each sounds name and file in an array, and the info/instructions for the audio visualizer. Aesthetically, I had the circles pop and react to the audio data further adding to the immersion the circles bring. I also allowed users to click the screen and add more phylotaxis circles so they can have some fun with the audio visualizer. I would say I should get about 8% for this section. My contributions are pretty cool I think but they aren't mind blowing especially since I've seen some really amazing versions of the audio visualizer.
